# CMakeLists.txt for usr/sys/conf
# This directory contains kernel configuration files and tools.
# mkconf.c is a tool that would be compiled for the host to generate kernel files.
# conf.c is generated by mkconf.c.
# low.s and mch.s are PDP-11 assembly.

# For now, this CMakeLists.txt is a placeholder.
# We might later add a custom target to build mkconf.c for the host system
# and then run it as part of a kernel build process.
