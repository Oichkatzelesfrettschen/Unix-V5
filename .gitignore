# Specific to this project if they are outputs
cal # Example executable from previous steps
v5root.tar.gz # This is source, but large. Consider if it should be git LFS or not checked in if extracted.
              # For now, keeping it as it was in the original ls. If it's to be extracted, exclude the extracted dir.

# If Unix v5 source is extracted from v5root.tar.gz into a specific directory
# and that dir is not the primary working tree, exclude it.
# Example: extracted_v5_source/
